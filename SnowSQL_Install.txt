# SnowSQL Installation and Configuration Guide

## Step 1: Download SnowSQL

1. Go to the Snowflake website and download the appropriate installer for your operating system:
   - For Windows: Download the `snowsql-windows_x86_64.msi` installer
   - For Mac/Linux: Download the appropriate package for your system
   - The installer can be found in the Snowflake web interface under Help > Download

## Step 2: Install SnowSQL

For Windows:
1. Open the downloaded `snowsql-windows_x86_64.msi` file
2. Follow the installer instructions
3. The default installation directory will be `%ProgramFiles%\Snowflake SnowSQL`
4. Alternatively, you can install via command line:
   ```powershell
   msiexec /i snowsql-windows_x86_64.msi /q
   ```

## Step 3: Configure SnowSQL

1. Create/edit the configuration file:
   - Location: `%USERPROFILE%\.snowsql\config`
   - If it doesn't exist, running `snowsql` for the first time will generate it

2. Add your connection details to the config file:
   ```ini
   [connections]
   # Default connection parameters
   accountname = your_account_identifier    # e.g., xy12345.east-us-2.azure
   username = your_username
   password = your_password
   
   # Optional parameters
   dbname = your_database                   # Default database
   schemaname = your_schema                 # Default schema
   warehousename = your_warehouse           # Default warehouse
   rolename = your_role                     # Default role
   
   [options]
   # Optional settings
   auto_completion = True
   output_format = psql
   log_level = INFO
   timing = True
   ```

## Step 4: Secure the Configuration (Important!)

Since the password is stored in plain text, secure the config file:
- For Windows, right-click the config file → Properties → Security → Edit permissions to restrict access to only your user account

## Step 5: Verify Installation

1. Open a command prompt
2. Check the SnowSQL version:
   ```powershell
   snowsql -v
   ```

## Step 6: Connect to Snowflake

After configuration, you can connect using:
```powershell
snowsql
```

Or with specific parameters (overriding config file):
```powershell
snowsql -a <account> -u <username> -d <database> -w <warehouse>
```

## Additional Tips

1. If you need to use a specific version of SnowSQL, you can force it using:
   ```powershell
   snowsql -v <version_number>
   ```
2. The configuration file supports multiple connection profiles under different names
3. You can use environment variables instead of storing credentials in the config file
4. For passwords with special characters, enclose them in single or double quotes in the config file

## Common Issues and Solutions

1. If you encounter connection issues:
   - Verify your account identifier format is correct
   - Check your network connectivity
   - Ensure your credentials are correct
   - Verify your firewall settings

2. If you need to update SnowSQL:
   - The client will auto-update when connected to Snowflake
   - You can force a specific version using the -v flag

## Security Best Practices

1. Never share your config file containing credentials
2. Regularly rotate your passwords
3. Consider using SSO or external browser authentication when possible
4. Use the minimum required role privileges for your connections
